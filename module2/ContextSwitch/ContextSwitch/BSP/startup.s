;
; The code that lives at the boot vector 
; When the Cortex starts from power up it 
;   sets the stack pointer register to the value at the boot vector
;   sets the program counter to the value at the reset vector
;   starts execution

; Define a name for this module of code/data (ie the code in this file, only 1 modules per file is allowed)
; this module will be placed at the boot vector of the Cortex by the linker (see the linker cmd line for explanation)
;
      MODULE    startupCode   
;
; Code is split into logical sections using the SECTION directive. This allows
; the position of code and data to be controlled, important to put the reset vector
; in the correct place

; How much stack is needed?
;  This depends upon what is put on it and how deep it goes (and use of recursion...) 
;  On Cortex The stack is 'fully descending' that means that the stack pointer always holds the pointer of the last stacked item. 
;  The CPU will decrement the stack pointer *before* writing to it
; Why does the stack type matter? 
;   Well if the stack is growing downwards how will you known if the bounds of the stack have been exceeded? You don't unless you gaurd against is.
;   A simple way of preventing clobbering of code/data due to stack overflow is to put it at a place in RAM where it cannot continue to growm ie at the bottom of RAM
; Hence the stack pointer is set to the lowest address of RAM plus the desired stack size.
; The stack and its location are setup in the linker configuration file (startupexample.icf)
; Forward declare that stack data section here, its actual location will be determine by the linker file.
;     the alignment is (3) which means 2 ^ 3, AKA 64 bit alignment
      SECTION CSTACK:DATA:NOROOT(3)

       
;
;     Create a data section to hold the Vector table addresses
;     it is called .intvec, it contains DATA 
;     ROOT determines id the linker will include the section even if it is not  used
;     NOROOT will cause the linke to discard unused sections
;     the alignment is (2) which means 2 ^ 2, AKA 32 bit alignment
;     NOTE: .intvec is a convention for the section with the interrupt vectors
      SECTION   .intvec:CODE:ROOT(2)


;       These are the  stock Cortex interrupt vectors (well, some of them) 
;       The only ones used in this example are Reset and SysTick
;       The rest are declared as 'weak' for now
;       (NOTE that IAR needs the name to be  __vector_table for the debugger and C-Spy to work correctly)
